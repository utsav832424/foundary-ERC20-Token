## About

This Project is to create a ERC20 Token. Where people can send or receive Token. Tokens can be transferred between Ethereum addresses.

Users can interact with the ERC20 token contract through various functions, including:

- `totalSupply()`: Get the total supply of tokens.
- `balanceOf(address account)`: Get the token balance of a specific address.
- `transfer(address receiver, uint256 amount)`: Transfer tokens from the sender's address to the specified receiver.
- `transferFrom(address sender, address receiver, uint256 amount)`: Transfer tokens from one address to another if approved by the sender.
- `approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`: Allow another address to spend tokens on behalf of the sender.

## Tests!
